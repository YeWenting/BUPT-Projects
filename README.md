# Term-Projects

## Java-Exercise

### Java

Junior, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (Java)

Score: Unavailable(current)

It contains two homewroks now, and there will be a term project at the end of this semester

See the [code](https://github.com/YeWenting/Java-Exercise)

## BUPT Contact
### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python

Junior, Web Programming Techniques

Score: Unavailable(current)

It can:
* Sign up and sign in
* Add/edit a friend's information

I use:
* __Bootstrap__ to control the CSS
* __jquery-validation__ to verify the validation of the input message
* __jquery-alert__ to send pretty alert block

## Results Management System
### C++

Semophore, OOP Design and Practice C++(2)

Score: 100

It allows:
1. teachers to view the students who attend his class, edit scores and see scores in order.
2. students to see the optional/required courses they attend, select or cancel the optional courses, and check their scores.
3. login and connnect to the system through TCP/IP
4. server to serve many clients at the same time

I use:
* __Singleton pattern__ to protect the system's information
* __Socket library__ to establish the connection between clients & servers
* __Select() API__ to control the multiple clients' status.

See the [document(CHINESE) and code](https://github.com/YeWenting/Results-Management-System)

## Travel Simulation System (3 People)
### C++

Semophore, Programming for Data Structures

Score:97

It's able to:
1. Designed three route design algorithm, which are time, cost or both time and cost optimized, while passing through several given vertices too
2. Display visitors' movement and routes by a fine-designed UI

I use:
* __SPFA & Floyd–Warshall algorithm__ to obtain first-step answer
* __Reformulated simulated annealing algorithm__ to solve the NP-hard problem in a short time
* __Branch and bound method__ to optimize the route both in time and cost

While my teammates([Okersira](https://github.com/Okersira), [dongshenghua](https://github.com/dongshenghua?tab=following)) are responsible of the Qt's part. Thanks to them!
