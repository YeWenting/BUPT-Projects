## <h3 id='results'>Results Management System</h3>


**Semophore, OOP Design and Practice C++(2)**

**Language: C++**

**Score: 100**

It allows:
1. teachers to view the students who attend his class, edit scores and see scores in order.
2. students to see the optional/required courses they attend, select or cancel the optional courses, and check their scores.
3. login and connnect to the system through TCP/IP
4. server to serve many clients at the same time

I use:
* __Singleton pattern__ to protect the system's information
* __Socket library__ to establish the connection between clients & servers
* __Select() API__ to control the multiple clients' status.

See the [document(CHINESE) and code](https://github.com/YeWenting/Results-Management-System)

## <h3 id='travel'>Travel Simulation System (3 People)</h3>

**Semophore, Programming for Data Structures**

**Language: C++**

**Score:97**

It's able to:
1. Designed three route design algorithm, which are time, cost or both time and cost optimized, while passing through several given vertices too
2. Display visitors' movement and routes by a fine-designed UI

I use:
* __SPFA & Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm__ to obtain first-step answer
* __Reformulated simulated annealing algorithm__ to solve the NP-hard problem in a short time
* __Branch and bound method__ to optimize the route both in time and cost

While my teammates([Okersira](https://github.com/Okersira), [dongshenghua](https://github.com/dongshenghua?tab=following)) are responsible of the Qt's part. Thanks to them!
